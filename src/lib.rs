//! A Rust port of the `dlmalloc` allocator.
//!
//! The `dlmalloc` allocator is described at
//! http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html and this Rust crate is a straight
//! port of the C code for the allocator into Rust. The implementation is
//! wrapped up in a `Dlmalloc` type and has support for Linux, OSX, and Wasm
//! currently.
//!
//! The primary purpose of this crate is that it serves as the default memory
//! allocator for the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target in the standard library.
//! Support for other platforms is largely untested and unused, but is used when
//! testing this crate.
